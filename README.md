# Mod11-Note-Taker

![License Badge](https://badgen.net/static/license/MIT/blue)

## Description
The purpose of this project was to use Express.js to create a backend server for a prewritten front-end. The application saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
In it's current state, the GET, POST, and DELETE API requests in the server.js file work in Insomnia, but I cannot figure out why the note.html page is not functional. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

## Installation

## Credits
I learned a lot from this [youtube tutorial] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE
I copied the app.get('/api/notes') section copied from the Module 11 ex 28 mini-project.
The POST request is similar to class exersize 20 module 11.
